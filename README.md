I built this model as a practice for fastai's resnet

The dataset has been taken from Kaggle, available here - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lazrus/indian-coin-denomination-dataset-icdd/data

The model was further pushed to Huggingface spaces to play with, available here - https://huggingface.co/spaces/yongelucas1/cointester

Model's training performance was pretty good, but doesn't seem to work very well for real-world examples.
